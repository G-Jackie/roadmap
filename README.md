## DMP Roadmap

DMP Roadmap is a Data Management Planning tool. It allows users to create data management plans for the projects using funder specific templates and institutional guidance. Once a plan has been completed it can be downloaded and inserted into your grant proposals.

Management and development of the DMP Roadmap is jointly provided by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), http://www.dcc.ac.uk/, and the University of California Curation Center (UC3), http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/

The tool has four main functions
1. To help create and maintain different versions of Data Management Plans;
2. To provide useful guidance on data management issues and how to meet research funders' requirements;
3. To export attractive and useful plans in a variety of formats;
4. To allow collaborative work when creating Data Management Plans.
